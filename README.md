# PlaylistsAnalyzer
Jupyter Python Notebook to analyze the playlists on www.file-under-ska.de.

Following Kirill Eremenko's advice in his book [Confident Data Skills: Master the Fundamentals of Working with Data and Supercharge Your Career](https://www.amazon.com/Confident-Data-Skills-Fundamentals-Supercharge/dp/0749481544) I chose data I am familiar with to experiment with Python's visualization capabilities: The approx. 10.000 songs I have played in my radio show www.file-under-ska.de since 2003.

The code parses the playlists and puts all songs (artist / title / date played / new release?) into a table.

Next: Try different diagram types to display which artists and songs were played most often etc.
